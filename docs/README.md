# Wazuh Guided Lab — GUI App
A single-page app that feels like a desktop wizard: step list, progress, screenshots, copyable commands, checklists (saved locally), and a searchable issue solver.

## Use
1. Open `index.html` locally or host on GitHub Pages.
2. Replace images in `/assets/` with real screenshots (keep names).
3. (Optional) Put your PDF in `assets/pdf/`.

## Customize
- Edit `data.js` to add steps, commands, and troubleshooting entries.
